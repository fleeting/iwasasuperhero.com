**Monkee-Boy**:
> Happy Friday, crew! We’re so glad to back in the swing of things with our regular releases of Freebie Fridays.
>
> We’re loving the recent geometric trends we’ve seen around the web this year, and wanted to join the party with a release of our own. Each of these colorful polygon backgrounds is 1600px x 1600px and in .jpg format, ready for dropping in your next design project. Of course, these patterns are absolutely free for personal & commercial use. Use, enjoy, and share with your friends.

I am constantly impressed with the talent of the [design team](http://www.monkee-boy.com/about/the-troop.php) I get to work with and love that they like to do these freebie design packs. This time it's some pretty awesome polygon backgrounds that I think would go great as an iPhone lock screen. Check out the full set at [monkee-boy.com](http://monkee-boy.com/blog/2014/05/freebie-friday-25-colorful-polygon-backgrounds/).
