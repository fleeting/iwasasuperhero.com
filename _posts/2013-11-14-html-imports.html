<p>HTML5 Rocks has a lot of great articles on Web Components and recently posted about <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/imports/">HTML Imports</a>. Currently only Chrome v31+ has support for it but it's exciting to see this take shape and it get added to the other browsers. You can also use the <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/platform/html-imports.html">Polymer HTML Imports polyfill</a> for support in IE10+, Safari 6+, Mobile Safari, and Chrome Android. HTML Imports is a simple way to include HTML docs in other HTML docs. In thise case you aren't limited to markup; the import can include CSS, JavaScript, or anything else. You are then able to use the different sections of that imported doc. There are some great use cases with frameworks like Foundation and Boostrap. Check it out and get excited.</p>
