<p>Today starts yet another South by Southwest and I'm stoked to be here for it. This is my fourth SXSW but I'm changing things up a little since I live in Austin now and am volunteering. I chose the production Film Venue Crew and have my first shift on Wednesday. I'm excited to volunteer and see a little behind the scenes but we can't forget about all the great panels and amazing films. I opted for the gold badge again and after watching a ton of trailers the past week; I can't wait to start watching what should be a great line up of films.</p>

<p>There are so many great events over the next week but if I've learned anything from previous years; I won't get to do everything and will still have an amazing time. There are a few events that I won't miss however including the screening of Joss Whedon's <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em> and his panel right after with the actors. With Whedon, Alexis Denisof, Amy Acker, Clark Gregg, and Nathan Fillion there is no way it won't be the highlight of the week (and most likely the year).</p>

<p>A few other quick events that I hope to check out include the NASA Webb Telescrop Exhibit, Unhung Hero, The Fifth Season, Kilimanjaro, The Real Responsive Process, Marvel: House of Ideas, The Network, Don Jon, Hawking, Grow Up, Tony Phillips, This is Where We Live, Scenic Route, Cirque du Soleil #EVOKE13, Zero Charisma, We Cause Scenes, and so much more. If I'm able to fit half of my schedule in then it will have been a great week. My volunteer shifts are at the Vimeo Theater in the ACC which should be fun and allow me to see a few things here and there.</p>

<p>I plan to do a aftermath post of the experience however if you don't see that post within a few weeks (or months) just know that the week was amazing and I was most likely too busy with Minecraft to do another blog post. I have my badge and volunteer shirts in hand so lets get this week started!</p>
