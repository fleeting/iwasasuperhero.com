<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twofivethreetwo/sets/72157622939977369/"><img class="alignleft" title="Chase &amp; Rachael (Christmas 2009)" src="/images/thekids-playinginsnow.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a>I&#8217;ve been screaming obscenities since coming into this world on June 3, 1985. Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma then raised in Iowa Park, Texas and Lawton, Oklahoma and now residing in Wichita Falls, Texas. I got married on December 7, 2007 to Melissa who is currently in her final year of nursing school at MSU. I have spawned two kids; a son Chase David born March of 2003 and a daughter Rachael Leigh born in 2005 (pictured left).</p>

<h2>Current Work</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what others call me, but I call myself a web designer and developer. I first start dabbling in web design back in 2001 and have been obsessed with it since. I really started doing web development in 2003 and have been doing it since. I was a freelance web designer for 5 years doing a wide range of client work. I worked with WordPress exclusively during that time. August 2008 began a new phase for me as I started working for DigiMedia.com here in Wichita Falls as a web designer and Ruby on Rails developer. After a year DigiMedia I was given a great opportunity and left the company to work for Crane | West Advertising Agency in October 2009. I&#8217;m currently the lead developer there and have worked on a variety of client websites and projects along with developing our custom in-house Content Management System. Beyond typical websites I have done Facebook customizations, been a part of social campaigns, planned and created television commercials, developed internal web apps and help manage two digital billboards.</p>

<h2>Deskography</h2>
<p>Apple products have ruled this house for several years. At work I use a 27&#8243; iMac (2011) and at home I use a 15&#8243; MacBook Pro (2010) or a Samsung 3G Chromebook for more casual browsing.</p>
