There are so many reason to oppose SOPA and PIPA. Google has setup a great take action page: [End Piracy, Not Liberty](https://www.google.com/landing/takeaction/ "Google End Piracy, Not Liberty"). For a completely different approach to the internet wide blackout, leave it up to [theoatmeal.com](http://theoatmeal.com/sopa "The Oatmeal Stop SOPA").
