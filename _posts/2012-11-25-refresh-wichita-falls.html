<p>A few years ago a few of us from Digimedia tried to start up a monthly Ruby/Rails user group that never really took off. I came to the conclusion that although Wichita Falls could support a web community, it would be difficult to have that group center around a language or a specific area of the web. Instead I wanted to get a monthly web user group going but never found the time. Fast forward a few years and the idea came up again when talking with <a href="https://twitter.com/jslaybaugh" title="Follow @jslaybaugh">Jorin Slaybaugh</a> earlier this year. We wanted to build a community around the web professionals in the area. We emailed several times over a few days discussing what we both wanted out of a user group and what could happen in this area. We ended up with <a href="http://refreshwichitafalls.com/">Refresh Wichita Falls</a>.</p>

<p>Keeping inline with the Refresh manifesto we were excited to add Wichita Falls to the list of <a href="http://refreshingcities.com/">Refreshing Cities</a>. Our goal was to build a community that could grow, learn, share, and ultimately inspire each of us. We had our first meeting in May and have had speakers every month since. It has been a slow start but the group is starting to take shape and will continue better then ever in 2013.</p>

<p>It has been a great experience helping get the community started but this months meeting was my last. I was lucky enough to join a few other speakers for a <a href="https://github.com/refreshwf/resource-roundtable" title="Refresh WF's Resource Roundtable @ GitHub">Resource Roundtable</a> and at least got my first speaking experience out of the way. However, since we are looking to move to Austin, Texas in the coming weeks I won't be here to see the group continue to grow and really take off. Jorin is already taking over though and has some exciting plans for next year. I do plan to return at some point next year to give my first full talk which I'm really looking forward to. I encourage everybody in the Wichita Falls/Lawton area to check out the group, get involved, and if you are interested in speaking hit up Jorin..</p>
