<p>I've used Foundation for awhile now and love it. It's great for prototyping, creating a clean look for a quick web app, giving your side/weekend/hackathon project a modern interface, and overall use on any site for the responsive grid and js components. Here at <a href="http://www.monkee-boy.com">Monkee-Boy</a> we use it on every site. In most cases we only include the SASS grid and any JavaScript we might need. I've also used it for side projects both for a user interface and for a quick site with a download link. It is an amazing, lightweight, fast, and versatile framework. It's now even better.</p>

<p>Last week Zurb finally released the next version of Foundation. <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation 5</a> is focused on speed; faster for users, faster for developers, faster to learn. This includes removing older selectors for IE8 and below, switching back to jQuery from Zepto, the new command line tool to start projects, and using Bower for Foundation upgrades. Two new additions will help with responsive sites; Interchange for responsive images and Off-canvas for those nice offscreen navigations. All elements in Foundation 5 have also been updated with a new modern look, more breathing room, and a reduced code size. Other features and improvements to note include easier forms, fastclick.js for mobile users, the ever popular medium grid, Sublime Snippets, new templates, and Libsassy for fast SASS compiling.</p>
