Not long ago I started adding [gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com/) to my per project boilerplate and dropped using CodeKit. If you aren't using it stop whatever you are doing, including reading this, and check it out. A few months ago I came across a little Chrome Extension, [grunt-devtools](https://github.com/vladikoff/grunt-devtools), that lets you run grunt tasks from the dev tools. I hadn't really put it to use until recently and it does come in handy.

You are able to run your tasks and see the output in devtools which are basically always open anyways. It saves that little switch to terminal if there are errors. If you already have a heavy devtools workflow then this extension should fit right in.
