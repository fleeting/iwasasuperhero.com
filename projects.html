<p>Below are some projects that I've released or am working on right now. You can find more projects at <a href="http://monkeecreate.com" title="monkeeCreate">monkeeCreate</a> or my <a href="http://github.com/jamesfleeting/" title="James Fleeting at Github">github</a>. </p>

<h2>Drought - HTML/CSS Barebones</h2>
<p><strong>Project: </strong><a title="Get Drought" href="http://jamesfleeting.github.com/Drought/">jamesfleeting.github.com/Drought</a></p>

<p>Just some barebones HTML/CSS to start each project. No single boilerplate or framework is perfect for all but here is what I've found works for me right now.</p>

<h2>jQuery.simpleWeather</h2>
<p><strong>Project: </strong><a title="jQuery.simpleWeather Plugin" href="http://simpleweather.monkeecreate.com">simpleweather.monkeecreate.com</a></p>

<p>A simple jQuery plugin to display the weather information for any location. The data is pulled from the public Yahoo! Weather feed via the YQL API. You provide a zip code (US only) or a location (US and International) and it returns everything you need. You choose how to format the html, what classes to apply and what information to use.</p>

<h2>Last.fm New Releases</h2>
<p><strong>Project: </strong><a title="Last.fm New Releases Chrome Extension" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nmnkdhjpjhggaaicdmafongigfhogcml">Last.fm New Releases on Chrome Webstore</a></p>

<p>Always on the hunt for new music from your favorite artists? This Google Chrome Extension displays new releases for your last.fm artists.</p>

<h2>jQuery.simpleLastFM</h2>
<p><strong>Project: </strong><a title="jQuery.simpleLastFM Plugin" href="http://simplelastfm.monkeecreate.com/">simplelastfm.monkeecreate.com</a></p>

<p>jQuery plugin that displays what your listening to, top artists, albums and more from your last.fm profile.</p>

<h2>dotfiles</h2>
<p><strong>Project: </strong><a title="dotfiles at GitHub" href="https://github.com/jamesfleeting/dotfiles">github.com/jamesfleeting/dotfiles</a></p>

<p>Basically just pretending like I know what I'm doing and joining the rage of dotfile repos. Just a place to store some of my dotfiles as a backup and to restore on new machines when needed. Credit goes to the tons of articles, tips and tricks and other dotfiles repos that I've browsed to get things exactly how I want them.</p>
