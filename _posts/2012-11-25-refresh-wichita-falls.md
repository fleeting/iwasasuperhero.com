A few years ago a few of us from Digimedia tried to start up a monthly Ruby/Rails user group that never really took off. I came to the conclusion that although Wichita Falls could support a web community, it would be difficult to have that group center around a language or a specific area of the web. Instead I wanted to get a monthly web user group going but never found the time. Fast forward a few years and the idea came up again when talking with [Jorin Slaybaugh](https://twitter.com/jslaybaugh "Follow @jslaybaugh") earlier this year. We wanted to build a community around the web professionals in the area. We emailed several times over a few days discussing what we both wanted out of a user group and what could happen in this area. We ended up with [Refresh Wichita Falls](http://refreshwichitafalls.com/).

Keeping inline with the Refresh manifesto we were excited to add Wichita Falls to the list of [Refreshing Cities](http://refreshingcities.com/). Our goal was to build a community that could grow, learn, share, and ultimately inspire each of us. We had our first meeting in May and have had speakers every month since. It has been a slow start but the group is starting to take shape and will continue better then ever in 2013.

It has been a great experience helping get the community started but this months meeting was my last. I was lucky enough to join a few other speakers for a [Resource Roundtable](https://github.com/refreshwf/resource-roundtable "Refresh WF's Resource Roundtable @ GitHub") and at least got my first speaking experience out of the way. However, since we are looking to move to Austin, Texas in the coming weeks I won't be here to see the group continue to grow and really take off. Jorin is already taking over though and has some exciting plans for next year. I do plan to return at some point next year to give my first full talk which I'm really looking forward to. I encourage everybody in the Wichita Falls/Lawton area to check out the group, get involved, and if you are interested in speaking hit up Jorin..
