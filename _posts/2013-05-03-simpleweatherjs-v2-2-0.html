<p>Had a few issues opened on simpleWeather mostly dealing with alt temps (showing both F and C temps) so went ahead and pushed out v2.2.0 this week. After three years I finally added a readme file to the repo, no clue what took me so long. You might also notice that the plugin has grown up to get its very own domain, <a href="http://simpleweatherjs.com">simpleweatherjs.com</a>.</p>

<p>Finally for those who like choices; simpleWeather is now available to be installed using <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> and for those who would rather use a CDN, it is now being served up from <a href="http://cdnjs.com/">cdnjs.com</a>. The info is on the website and the readme. That is <a href="http://simpleweatherjs.com">v2.2.0</a> so go get it!</p>
