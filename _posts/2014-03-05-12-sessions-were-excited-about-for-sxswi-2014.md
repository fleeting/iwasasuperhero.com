[SXSW](http://sxsw.com) kicks off Friday and the [Monkee-Boy](http://twitter.com/monkeeboy) team couldn't be more excited. With a wealth of sessions going on we have been sorting through them a lot over the last few weeks and have compiled a list of [12 sessions](http://monkee-boy.com/blog/2014/03/designux-sessions-were-excited-about-for-sxswi-2014/) that we are most excited about. Everything from the PostPSD Era, the love of UX, being happy in your office, future of responsive design, and plenty more. This is a pretty small collection of what we hope to take in over the next several days; not to mention Film and Music! If you are attending SXSW tweet us what sessions you are excited about at [@monkeeboy](http://twitter.com/monkeeboy).
