This repo is the home of my blog which is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub](http://github.com). WordPress become to bulky and I prefer to code my posts in html anyways so Jekyll was a perfect fit. The starting point for this site was [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) This blog is a continuation from [paperkilledrock.com](http://paperkilledrock.com) (the blog before).
