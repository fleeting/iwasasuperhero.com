A new year has started and I figured this would be a great time to clean things up. Of course, by clean things up I mean completely start fresh with a new domain, new look and new system. I will be leaving up my [old blog](http://paperkilledrock.com "PaperKilledRock.com") in read-only mode just for archive purposes. There are a few select posts over the past year or two that I will move over (and update as needed) soon however this is pretty much a clean start and an attempt to stay active with writing.

With the new blog I have dropped WordPress for the first time in who knows how many years of using it. I grew tired of WordPress and how bulky it was for what I used it for. I found myself using very few plugins and I wrote most of the posts in HTML vs the wysiwyg. I went looking for something that was going to be fast, lightweight and flexible. I explored a few options and finally jumped into [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"). Jekyll is a static site generator that lets you write posts in html, textile or markdown. This is also the same engine behind [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages"). I loved the ideal of not having my posts in a database and keeping such a simple structure. Jekyll was extremely easy to use and with the help of [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/ "Jekyll Bootstrap"), I had the new site up and running. I haven't found myself limited by the system in any way. On a side note: this site is hosted and served up by GitHub. Feel free to [check out the repo](https://github.com/jamesfleeting/iwasasuperhero.com "iwasasuperhero.com GitHub Repo") and browse the code, the site is MIT Licensed besides posts and images.

This year should be a busy one, with my wife graduating from nursing school in December and our inevitable move at the same time. I have a few projects that need to get finished and several to get off the ground over the next several months and really want to put more effort and focus into writing.
