> The SC5 Style Guide Generator builds a living style guide from style source code. It provides a command line interface and both Gulp and Grunt build tasks wrapped in a single npm package. In the simplest use case, the user defines which files are to be processed and to which directory the generated files should be written.

At [Monkee-Boy](http://monkee-boy.com) we are exploring using style guides for all our projects. I'm excited to jump more into [KSS](http://warpspire.com/kss/) and seeing how it works out for us. This [SC5 Style Guide Generator](http://styleguide.sc5.io/) looks awesome in automating this process and keeping style guides up to date as a project evolves over time.
