After just under four years at [CRANE | WEST](http://crane-west.com) I will be leaving the company. I’ve had the privilege to work on some great projects over this time and it has been fun. Our clients are almost always fun to work with and of course I’ve made some great friends along the way. Not to mention getting to jump outside the development side and shoot some [tv commercials](http://getthegoldenglow.com/), do some audio editing, run a social campaign, and more. Overall it has been a great experience working with the rest of the CW team, past and present.

We moved to [Austin](/2013/01/austin-texas/) at the end of December which opened up a whole new set of opportunities for my career. I’m excited to say that on Friday **I accepted an offer at [Monkee Boy](http://monkee-boy.com)** as their **Sr. Front End Developer** starting in September. After meeting the MBoy team and hearing about the company and the work they do; I knew this was the place for me and I look forward to joining the team.

It’s always a little nerve wracking to come into a new team since I’ve worked with mostly the same team for five years now. I’m up for the challenge though and excited at what I can bring to the Monkee Boy team and what I can learn from them.
