<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twofivethreetwo/sets/72157622939977369/"><img class="alignleft" title="Chase &amp; Rachael (Christmas 2009)" src="/images/thekids-playinginsnow.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a>This is just your typical about page, only not nearly as good. I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma then raised in Iowa Park, Texas and Lawton, Oklahoma, later moving to Wichita Falls, Texas for Melissa to attend nursing school at Midwestern State University, then relocated to beautiful Austin, Texas and now residing in Boston, MA. I'm married and have two awesome kids (pictured left).</p>

<p>I first start dabbling in web design back in 2001 and have been obsessed with it since. I really started doing web development professionaly in 2003. I was a freelance web designer and developer for 5 years doing a wide range of client work. I worked with WordPress exclusively during that time. August 2008 began a new phase for me as I started working for <a href="http://digimedia.com" title="DigiMedia.com">DigiMedia.com</a> in Wichita Falls as a web designer and Ruby on Rails developer. I was part of a small team developing a large scale e-commerce solution to power hundreds of domains. After a year at DigiMedia I was given a great opportunity and left the company to work for <a href="http://crane-west.com" title="CRANE | WEST">CRANE | WEST</a> in October 2009. I was the senior front-end developer and worked on a variety of client projects along with developing a custom in-house Content Management System. Beyond typical projects, I have done Facebook customizations, been a part of social campaigns, planned and filmed television commercials, developed internal web apps and help manage two digital billboards. In September 2013 I accepted an offer to be the Sr. Front End Developer at <a href="http://monkee-boy.com">Monkee-Boy</a> in Austin, Texas.
