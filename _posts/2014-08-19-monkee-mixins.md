At [Monkee-Boy](http://monkee-boy.com) we use and love SASS. This of course means we have slowly put together a collection of mixins and functions that we use all the time. Some of the mixins are pretty common and others we have found helpful enough to want at our disposal all the time. Some of these include vertical-align, centerer, ratio, CSS triangle, font-face, breakpoints, and the typical vendor prefixes. We have the mixins up in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Monkee-Boy/_mixins.scss) if you feel inclined to check it out. You can install using `bower install monkee-mixins` or `npm install monkee-mixins`.

Check out the [Monkee-Boy GitHub](https://monkee-boy.github.io/) for more projects. It's not much right now but more is coming.
