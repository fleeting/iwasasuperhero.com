> There is no shortage of boilerplates and frameworks that web developers can choose from to use in their projects. I don’t know about you, but I have usually felt like many of these frameworks were bloated and sometimes difficult to understand.

> That’s why I have fallen in love with the Drought boilerplate from James Fleeting. I could say Drought is a stripped down boilerplate that lets you get right into development, but that wouldn’t be a completely fair assessment. So, please allow me to explain by breaking down Drought into the three main components of any website: HTML, CSS, and Javascript

[Drought](http://jamesfleeting.github.com/Drought/) is finally growing up. I pushed out v3.0 last week and today it gets its [first review](http://designsnack.com/blog/reviews/drought-boilerplate-review/). [Eric Binnion](http://twitter.com/ebinnion) over at DesignSnack.com gave Drought lots of love today so a huge thanks to Eric for the writeup. I will also be showing off a little of Drought on Monday, November 19th at [Refresh Wichita Falls](http://refreshwichitafalls.com/) as part of a resource roundtable event.
