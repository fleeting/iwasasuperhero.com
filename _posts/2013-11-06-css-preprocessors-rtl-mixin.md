A brilliant mixin from [David Walsh](http://davidwalsh.name/stylus-parent-selectors) to let you quickly manage properties for RTL support. Works in Stylus, LESS, and SASS. Beyond RTL support he shows how the same pattern can be for featured-based classes. Awesome! His example is in Stylus but I did a quick SASS version below.
