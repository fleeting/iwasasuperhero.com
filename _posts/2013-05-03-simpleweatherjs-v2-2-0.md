Had a few issues opened on simpleWeather mostly dealing with alt temps (showing both F and C temps) so went ahead and pushed out v2.2.0 this week. After three years I finally added a readme file to the repo, no clue what took me so long. You might also notice that the plugin has grown up to get its very own domain, [simpleweatherjs.com](http://simpleweatherjs.com).

Finally for those who like choices; simpleWeather is now available to be installed using [Bower](http://bower.io/) and for those who would rather use a CDN, it is now being served up from [cdnjs.com](http://cdnjs.com/). The info is on the website and the readme. That is [v2.2.0](http://simpleweatherjs.com) so go get it!
