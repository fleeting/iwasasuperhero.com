Instagram Blog:

> You’ve asked for Instagram on the web and we’ve listened. Over the next few days, we’ll be rolling out Instagram profiles on the web!
>
> Your web profile features a selection of your recently shared photographs just above your profile photo and bio, giving others a snapshot of the photos you share on Instagram. In addition, you can follow users, comment & like photos and edit your profile easily and directly from the web. It’s a beautiful new way to share your Instagram photos!

I was starting to think they would never have web profiles. The missing piece for [Instagram](http://instagram.com/) has finally made its debut and the web profiles really do look amazing. Granted the lack of profiles hasn't kept Instagram down or slowed their growth, it is still something we have all waited for. Looks like [my profile](http://instagram.com/fleeting "@fleeting on Instagram") hasn't been turned on yet but check out this one for [@mycookingdiary](http://instagram.com/mycookingdiary "@mycookingdiary on Instagram").
