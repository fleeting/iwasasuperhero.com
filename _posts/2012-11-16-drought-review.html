<blockquote><p>There is no shortage of boilerplates and frameworks that web developers can choose from to use in their projects. I don’t know about you, but I have usually felt like many of these frameworks were bloated and sometimes difficult to understand.</p>

<p>That’s why I have fallen in love with the Drought boilerplate from James Fleeting. I could say Drought is a stripped down boilerplate that lets you get right into development, but that wouldn’t be a completely fair assessment. So, please allow me to explain by breaking down Drought into the three main components of any website: HTML, CSS, and Javascript</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://jamesfleeting.github.com/Drought/">Drought</a> is finally growing up. I pushed out v3.0 last week and today it gets its <a href="http://designsnack.com/blog/reviews/drought-boilerplate-review/">first review</a>. <a href="http://twitter.com/ebinnion">Eric Binnion</a> over at DesignSnack.com gave Drought lots of love today so a huge thanks to Eric for the writeup. I will also be showing off a little of Drought on Monday, November 19th at <a href="http://refreshwichitafalls.com/">Refresh Wichita Falls</a> as part of a resource roundtable event.</p>
