I recently pushed out a new version of [simpleWeather](http://simpleweatherjs.com/). With v2.4 [<small>[diff]</small>](https://github.com/monkeecreate/jquery.simpleWeather/commit/c8375fbc7c27f0b311a9f1a2156be8c0cf66e043) you now have access to a five day forecast instead of just tomorrow. It still uses the Yahoo Weather API but that is subject to change if I find a better one that I like. What's next for simpleWeather? I'm working on a few great demos to show simpleWeather in action and give more unique cases for using it. Outside of that I'm actively looking into other weather APIs that might offer more data for me to serve up. Yahoo's is fairly easy to use and doesn't require an API key. I'm open to recommendations though so hit me up at [@fleetingftw](http://twitter.com/fleetingftw) if you have any thoughts. Until then go check out [simpleWeather v2.4](http://simpleweatherjs.com/).
