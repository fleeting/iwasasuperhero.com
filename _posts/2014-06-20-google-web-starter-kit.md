[![Web Starter Kit](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s38/sh/bc92d8ef-b223-4ccd-bd8b-e120e1bf5e2a/bb5a38147104d0b2f6465e90ee718340/deep/0/Web-Starter-Kit.png)](https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit/)

Google recently pushed out it's [Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit/) which is a boilerplate for coding responsive sites. Supporting multiple devices, gulp.js, SASS, and browsersync for testing across devices. As it's another project by Addy Osmani and Sindre Sorhus, at the very least it's worth checking out. I've spent a little time digging around it and pretty excited about what it brings to the table. Besides being a great starting point it also includes a nice visual component style guide which makes it a little more like Bootstrap or Foundation than H5BP. Check out the full code on Github at [google/web-starter-kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit).
